# Computational-Complexity-Algorithm

Welcome to the Computational-Complexity-Algorithm repository! This project is aimed at...

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine.

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to your Documents directory using the following command:

    ```bash
    cd Documents
    ```

3. Clone this repository using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/manavtore/OperatingSystem.git
    ```

To compile a `file.cpp` and run the output file, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `src` directory:

    ```bash
    cd OperatingSystem
    ```

2. Compile the `file.c` using a C compiler (replace `file` with the actual filename):

    ```bash
    gcc file.cpp -o output
    ```

    This command compiles `file.c` and creates an executable named `output`.

4. Run the compiled executable:

    ```bash
    ./output
    ```

    This command executes the compiled program.
